For the main content of your webpage, you'll want colors that complement the header and footer while providing good contrast for readability. Since #f1eeea is a light color, you might want to go with darker tones for the main content to create visual balance. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Contrasting Neutrals**: Consider using shades of gray like #333333 or #666666 for text and #cccccc for backgrounds.

2. **Warm Accents**: If you want to introduce some warmth, you can use muted warm tones like #a8795d or #b39b76 for elements like buttons or highlights.

3. **Cool Tones**: Cool tones like blues or greens can provide a calming effect. You could try #336699 or #2e8b57 for accents.

4. **Soft Pastels**: Soft pastel colors can create a gentle, inviting look. Shades like #a6dcef or #f0c987 can work well with a light background.

5. **Earth Tones**: For a more natural feel, earthy colors like #8b4513 or #556b2f can be a good choice.

Remember to test these colors together to ensure they harmonize well and maintain readability.
